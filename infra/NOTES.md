## learning and todo

fargate needs special config vs. ec2 in an ecs cluster. the two are not capatible.

template files seems a good way to handle task definitions, check them out

use terraform aggregation / group operators (like group-creating subnets)

security:
- lockdown security groups
- waf
- have terraform create more limited IAM roles for ECS
- tighten abilities of github IAM role
- enable SSL across web/api/rds boundaries
- enforce more verbose logging
- secure the docker credentials in github action:
  >  Run aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1
  >    
  >  Warning: Your docker password is not masked. See https://github.com/aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login#docker-credentials for more information.

devops
- add scaffolding for debugging locally within docker-compose

# running migrate

after new Docker images have been published, run github workflows with the `gh` cli:

deploy:
```
gh workflow run 'Ukol SDLC - Infra Deploy' --ref <working_branch_name> -f target=unused
```
then run the db schema `migrate` ecs task manually (AWS console > ECS cluster > Tasks > Run Task...)
---
after you are done testing, teardown the env with the other github workflow:
```
gh workflow run 'Ukol SDLC - Infra Teardown' --ref <working_branch_name> -f target=unused
```

## todo
- run (auto?) when new infra is deployed
- run when new containers are deployed
- run arbitrarily
